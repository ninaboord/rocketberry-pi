## Project description
We will make a video game where you control a Raspberry Pi rocket ship using an accelerometer and a button to avoid and shoot bugs. Tilting the accelerometer moves the rocket left and right, and pressing the button shoots lasers at the bugs. Every time you shoot a bug, there will be a “bug destruction” animation, and you will gain a point. The objective of the game will be to gain as many points as possible before getting hit by a bug (which is game over). We will heavily focus on graphics, but hope to include sound if we have time. We hope to learn more about reading the outputs of accelerometers and how they can be used to change graphics. Furthermore, we would like to learn more about how we can optimize graphics and make them run faster. This will be super important as we will have multiple objects moving on the screen at one time.

## Hardware, budget
Resources needed: Accelerometer, materials for controller (small breadboard, box material)
Budget: $40 - we will probably not use all of it

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Nina Boord: accelerometer, graphics optimization
Ryan Dukes: art, sprite work (collision, velocity)
[We will work on most of the graphics together]

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
By the end of the week, we want to have a box displaying on screen that moves according to the accelerometer's input

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to?
Nope!

What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about?
Our main challenge will be optimizing the graphics enough for smooth gameplay. We are going to design our system around that limitation, trying to compensate for it whenever possible. Other than that, making the controller responsive and converting our sprite art to a useable format are two things we are concerned about, but think we will be able to overcome.

How can we help you succeed?
We will be religiously atending office hours, so that will be the most helpful.
